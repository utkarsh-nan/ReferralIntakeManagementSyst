# ReferralIntakeManagementSystem

This project involves a referral intake management system dataset that is used to track patient admission and recovery time through different stages. 
In each stage, the status of the patient, the time taken to reach that status along with the user id of the nurse involved in updating the record is saved. 
This dataset involves a total of 27 attributes encompassing of all the unique statuses of the patientâ€™s walkthrough before finally getting discharged from the hospital. 
The features present in the data set are first modeled into the relational database in the third normal form which further feeds the data into the data warehouse for the analysis purpose. 
Owing to the multi-dimensionality nature of the data, OLAP hypercube is used for an analytical understanding of the data.
This project was built using Mirosoft tools (SSMS,SSIS,SSAS).
